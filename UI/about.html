			SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK A MENTOR<br>
			
• Was there a time you messed up and felt like you’d failed? How did you bounce back?<br>

• How did you learn to embrace risk-taking?<br>

• Tell me about a recent business setback. How did you recover?<br>

• Think back to five years ago. Did you envision your career as it is today?<br>

• Was there ever a role you applied for and landed, but weren't 100% qualified to do? How did you proceed?<br>
